// The Prefetch component is used for pre-fetching data before it is needed. This is often done to ensure that data is loaded in advance and available when a user navigates to a component that requires it. 
// Essentially, it ensures that data is available in the Redux store before the user actually needs it.


//You must be thinking that why do we need those automatically built hooks out of endpoints as data fetching is already done through preFetch component  But even with pre-fetching, you need the useGetNotesQuery hook in your components to access the data, handle loading states, and manage errors. It also ensures that the component re-renders when the data changes.

// In your App.js, when the Prefetch component is used, it triggers fetching of notes and users data early. This means that by the time a user navigates to a route that requires notes data, itâ€™s already in the store.

// Component Use: In NotesList, you still use useGetNotesQuery to retrieve and display the data. This hook handles the state management specific to the NotesList component, such as displaying a loading spinner or error message if necessary.
